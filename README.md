[YTH2014](http://yth.org/live) Tutorial
==================
Exploring, Analyzing, and Visualizing Open Health Data on the Web
-----------------

I will upload slides and resources to this repository as they are available.

Description: 

Free-to-use health data abound on the web: HealthData.gov lists 1.1k datasets available, Census.gov provides myriad data on demographics and government assistance, and Kinsey Reporter's database of thousands of reports of sexual behavior is freely available. Leveraging these resources can increase one's power to explore data, conduct detailed analyses, and create web-enabled applications. 

This hands-on tutorial is aimed at experts in the heath domain interested in accessing and combining diverse data to inform research and decision making. We will use IPython notebook to obtain real data from Kinsey Reporter and the US Census, then combine and visualize it in map form.

Attendees should bring an internet-enabled computer with an updated, modern web browser. No programming knowledge is required or assumed, we will cover the elements of Python necessary to complete the tutorial.
